This is the final project of our bootcamp. It is a complete website featuring a backend built using Java. The project is structured as a Maven application, utilizing Spring MVC framework, JPA for database management, and a REST API for communication between the frontend and backend.

The frontend was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

The theme of the project was social impact. Our website aims to connect humanitarian associations with professionals across various fields. Humanitarian associations can submit help requests by opening a ticket, specifying the type of assistance they need and their location.

Professionals can browse tickets relevant to their expertise and geographic area and choose to accept tickets that align with their skills and availability. This platform fosters collaboration and provides a streamlined way to connect those in need with qualified individuals willing to help.

The project was made by: Paulo Ramos, Martim Maurício, Mário Ribeiro, and Rui Pena.
